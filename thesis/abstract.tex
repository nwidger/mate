  Nondeterministic execution makes multithreaded programming
  difficult.  Nondeterministic execution causes programs to produce
  different output given the same input, makes concurrency bugs
  difficult to reproduce and makes unit testing less conclusive.
  Recent research has shown that deterministic execution of parallel
  programs can be achieved with overhead small enough that it is
  sufficient for debugging purposes and perhaps even for deployment.
  Previous work has focused on deterministic execution of arbitrary
  C/C++ code by instrumenting the code with calls into a run-time
  framework.  My thesis instead focused on executing a Java-like
  language deterministically by implementing deterministic execution
  inside the virtual machine.  I believed that differences in the
  memory model, instruction set and architecture will allow
  deterministic execution of a Java-like language to be done with
  lower overhead than a C-like language.
