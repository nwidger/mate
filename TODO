* thread creation
** thread X has been instantiated, thread Y calls 'start' method
** need to add thread to thread set deterministically to ensure
   thread order in serial mode is deterministic
** if in parallel mode
*** thread Y blocks until its serial turn
** add thread X to end of thread set
* thread start
** 'start' method has been called on thread X by thread Y
** thread X blocks until start of its serial turn
* thread destruction
** thread X has executed all of its instructions and wishes to
   terminate
** if in parallel mode
*** thread X blocks until its serial turn
** thread X blocks until parallel mode
** thread X removes itself from the thread set
* thread join
** thread X wishes to wait until thread Y has finished executing
** until thread Y is destroyed, block for next mode
