* mc
* mas
* mvm
** thread set in heap must be sorted by creation time
** thread creation/destruction deferred until serial mode
** threads woken up serially using thread set in heap
** thread
*** add thread_dmp * pointer to thread
*** store instruction count there
*** jump table for operations
**** start/end of parallel mode
**** start/end of serial mode
**** start/end of round
**** thread creation
**** thread destruction
**** instruction execution
** object
*** add object_dmp * pointer to object
*** store ownership info there
*** jump table for operations
**** object read
**** object write
**** ownership change
***** shared/private
***** new owner
**** recursive depth setting
** nlock
*** jump table for operations
**** lock
**** unlock
*** when running DMP, these must be CAS (don't let control go to the
    OS scheduler)
** garbage_collector
*** run at end of serial mode
** dmp
*** global dmp * pointer
*** store current mode - parallel/serial
*** current quantum size
*** store deterministic ordering for serial mode
** invoke_method
*** call instruction execution op in thread_dmp
* mdb
* spec
* general
