** is it okay to use an object pointer in table_XXX and then use it after returning 
   from a function that may have dmp_thread_block'd?  I.e. entry pointer in table_get
   for loop after table_run_equals
** run actual getfield/aload instruction functions to get/set table fields
* mdb
* spec
* general

* evaluation
** quantum sizes: 1000, 10000 and 100000
** full and reduced serial mode
** ownership table granularity - 1, 5 and 10 depth
** 2, 4, 8 and 16 threads
